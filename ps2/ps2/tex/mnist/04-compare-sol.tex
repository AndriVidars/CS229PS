\begin{answer}
The test accuracy on the baseline model was 0.9298, and the accuracy on the regularized model was 0.9661. 
\\
From the loss plot for the baseline model we observe that the training loss keeps decreasing with more epochs whilst the validation("test") loss plateaus quickly. This signifies that the model is overfitting to the training data. From the second plot, we observe that the regularization seems to prevent overfitting.
