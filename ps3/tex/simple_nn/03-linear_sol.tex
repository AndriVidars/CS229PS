\begin{answer}
If we use linear activations, then the model output is just a simple seperator based on linear combinations of the input($x_1$ and $x_2$). That is, the model is only capable of making decision boundaries that are a line. Since the data is not linearly separable, we cannot achive 100\% accuracy with a linear model.
