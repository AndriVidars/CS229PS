\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(i)] For regression, we would return the average of the response variable for the items in the leaf nodes. Therefore we would change line 3 to\\ \textbf{return} Leaf(average($y$) in $Data$)
 \item[(ii)] For regression task, we minimize mean squared error. Since our predictions are based on the averages of leaf nodes, $\bar{y}$, we are minimizing, $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-\bar{y})^2}{n}$, that is, we minimize the variance. Therefore, we change line 7 in the code to\\
 $Variance_{i, v}$ = Weighted(Variance($Data_1.y$) + Variance($Data_2.y$))\\
 and correspondingly we change line 11 to \\
 $h^*, v^*$ = choose feature $h_i$ and split $v$ that has smallest $Variance_{i, v}$
\end{enumerate}
