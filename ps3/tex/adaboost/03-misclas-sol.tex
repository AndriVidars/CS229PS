\begin{answer}
The second stump will receive a higher coefficient value in the ensamble, that is $\hat{w}_2 > \hat{w}_1$ because the weighted error of the second learner is less than the weighted error of the first learner, since the second learner only misclassifies one point, and at that point has lower relative weight compared to the misclassified point for the first learner.
